# Match-4-Game
This demo is based on TypeScript created by Egret Engine. It includes the initialization of gems, the elimination of the gems and counting of the gems including the animation of these functions. When the counts of gems achieve a specific number, the gems in the map would increase and go to the next level of the game. The basic logic of the game is based on iterative algorithm and object-oriented programming. And I used the Tween function in egret to create the animation of the game demo.
